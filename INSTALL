Building mintty requires gcc >=3.x for Cygwin or MSYS. It can not be 
built with a MinGW compiler, because it relies on some Unix facilities 
that are not available on plain Windows, in particular pseudo terminal 
devices (ptys).

To compile, just run 'make'. (Add a -j option as desired.)
To install, simply copy mintty.exe to an appropriate place, e.g. /bin.

'make src' creates a source tarball.
'make cygwin17' creates a zip for binary release for Cygwin 1.7.
'make cygwin15' creates a zip for binary release for Cygwin 1.5.
'make msys' creates a zip for binary release for MSYS.
'make doc' creates a PDF version of the man page. (Needs ps2pdf.)
'make clean' removes created files.
